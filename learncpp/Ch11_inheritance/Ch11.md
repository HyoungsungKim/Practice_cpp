# Ch11 Introduction to inheritance

Object composition is just one of the two major ways that C++ lets you  construct complex classes. The second way is through inheritance, which models an “is-a” relationship between two objects.

- Unlike object composition, which involves creating new objects by combining and connecting other objects, ***inheritance involves creating new objects by directly acquiring the attributes and behaviors of other objects and then extending or specializing them***.

## 11.2 Basic inheritance in C++

Inheritance in C++ takes place between classes.  In an inheritance  (is-a) relationship, the class being inherited from is called the **parent class**, **base class**, or **superclass**, and the class doing the inheriting is called the **child class**, **derived class**, or **subclass**.
