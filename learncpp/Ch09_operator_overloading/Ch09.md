# Ch09 Operator overloading

## 9.2 Overloading the arithmetic operators using friend functions

It turns out that there are three different ways to overload operators:

- The member function way, the friend function way, and the normal  function way. In this lesson, we’ll cover the friend function way (because it’s more intuitive for most binary operators).
- Next lesson, we’ll discuss the normal function way.
- Finally, in a later lesson in  this chapter, we’ll cover the member function way.

## 9.3 Overloading operators using normal functions

Using a friend function to overload an operator is convenient because it gives you direct access to the internal members of the classes you’re operating on.

- However, if you don’t need that access, you can write your overloaded operators as normal functions.  

*Rule: Prefer overloading operators as normal functions instead of  friends if it’s possible to do so without adding additional functions*.

## 9.4 Overloading the I/O operators

### Overloading operator<<

Overloading operator<< is similar to overloading operator+  (they are both binary operators), except that the parameter types are  different.

```c++
friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& out, const Point& point);
```

Implementation

```c++
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Point& point) {
    out << "Point(" << point.m_x << ", " << point.m_y << ", " << point.m_z << ")";
    
    return out;
}
```

- The trickiest part here is the return type.  With the arithmetic  operators, we calculated and returned a single answer by value (because  we were creating and returning a new result).
  - ***However, if you try to  return std::ostream by value, you’ll get a compiler error.  This happens because std::ostream specifically disallows being copied***.
  - 레퍼런스로 리턴 할 때 내부에서 정의한 변수는 함수 끝날 때 사라짐.
  - 하지만 여기서는 레퍼런스로 받은 argument를 수정해서 이걸 리턴하기때문에 사라지는게 아님(원본 수정)
  - 그러면 원본을 수정하는데 왜 리턴하지?
  - ***Chain 처럼 쓰기 위해서!(클래스에서 this 리턴하는것 생각)***

**Overloading operator>>** 

```c++
std::istream& operator>> (std::istream& in, Point& point) {
    in >> point.m_x;
    in >> point.m_y;
    in >> point.m_z;
    
    return in;
}
```

### Member function vs normal vs friend

The following rules of thumb can help you determine which form is best for a given situation:

- If you’re overloading assignment (=), subscript ([]), function call  (()), or member selection (->), do so as a member function.
- If you’re overloading a ***unary operator***, do so as a ***member function***.
- If you’re overloading a ***binary operator*** that does not modify its  left operand (e.g. operator+), do so as a ***normal function (preferred) or friend function***.
- If you’re overloading a binary operator that modifies its left  operand, but you can’t modify the definition of the left operand (e.g.  operator<<, which has a left operand of type ostream), do so as a  normal function (preferred) or friend function.
- If you’re overloading a binary operator that modifies its left operand (e.g. operator+=), and you can modify the definition of the left operand, do so as a member function.

## 9.11 The copy constructor

And much like a default constructor, if you do not provide a copy constructor for your classes, C++ will create a public copy constructor for you. Because the compiler does not know much about your class, by  default, the created copy constructor utilizes a method of initialization called memberwise initialization.

- **Memberwise initialization** simply means that each member of the copy is initialized directly from the member of the class being copied.  

## 9.12 Copy initialization

```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
 
class Fraction
{
private:
	int m_numerator;
	int m_denominator;
 
public:
    // Default constructor
    Fraction(int numerator=0, int denominator=1) :
        m_numerator(numerator), m_denominator(denominator)
    {
        assert(denominator != 0);
    }
 
        // Copy constructor
	Fraction(const Fraction &copy) :
		m_numerator(copy.m_numerator), m_denominator(copy.m_denominator)
	{
		// no need to check for a denominator of 0 here since copy must already be a valid Fraction
		std::cout << "Copy constructor called\n"; // just to prove it works
	}
 
	friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction &f1);
        int getNumerator() { return m_numerator; }
        void setNumerator(int numerator) { m_numerator = numerator; }
};
 
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Fraction &f1)
{
	out << f1.m_numerator << "/" << f1.m_denominator;
	return out;
}
 
Fraction makeNegative(Fraction f) // ideally we should do this by const reference
{
    f.setNumerator(-f.getNumerator());
    return f;
}
 
int main()
{
    Fraction fiveThirds(5, 3);
    std::cout << makeNegative(fiveThirds);
 
    return 0;
}

// Output 
/*
Copy constructor called
Copy constructor called
-5/3
*/
```

- The first copy constructor call happens when fiveThirds passed as an  argument into makeNegative() parameter f.  The second call happens when  the return value from makeNegative() is passed back to main().
- 메인 함수에서 함수로 변수 넘길 때 복사 해서 넘김 ->  copy constructor 동작
- 함수에서 메인 함수로 넘길 때 복사 해서 넘김 -> copy constructor 동작
- 복사해서 넘기는게 아니라 레퍼런스 붙여서 원본으로 넘기면 copy constructor 동작 안할듯
- 애매하게 사용하면 copy constructor가 동작 할 수도 있으니 이니셜라이제이션 할 때 컬리 브라켓으로 하는게 좋음.

## 9.15 Shallow vs deep copying

### Shallow copy

Shallow copies of a pointer just copy the address of the pointer -- ***it  does not allocate any memory or copy the contents being pointed to***!

- 내부에 동적 할당이 있는 클래스를 얕은 복사하면 동적 할당 된 변수를 위해 새로운 메모리가 할당 되는게 아니라, 복사 한 클래스에서도 같은 주소를 사용함.
- 따라사 복사한 클래스에서 destructor을 호출해 동적 할당한 변수의 메모리를 반환하면 복사된 클래스의 변수의 메모리도 반환 됨.

### Deep copy

A **deep copy** allocates memory for the copy and then copies the actual value, so that the copy lives in distinct memory from the source.
