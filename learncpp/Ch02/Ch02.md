## Header guards

```c++
#ifndef SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE
#define SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE

#endif
```

When this header is #included, the preprocessor checks whether *SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE* has been previously defined. If this is the first time we’re including the header, *SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE* will not have been defined.  Consequently, it #defines *SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE* and includes the contents of the file. If the header is included again into the same file, *SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE* will already have been defined from the first time the contents of the  header were included, and the contents of the header will be ignored (thanks to the #ifndef).

- ***All of your header files should have header guards on them***.  *SOME_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE* can be any name you want, but by convention is set to the full filename of the header file, typed in all caps, using underscores for spaces or punctuation.

There are quite a few cases we’ll show you in the future where it’s necessary to put non-function definitions in a header file. 

- For  example, C++ will let you create your own types. These user-defined types are typically defined in header files, so the definition can be propagated out to the code files that need to use them.
- Without a  header guard, your code files can end up with multiple identical copies  of these definitions, which will cause a duplicate definition compilation error.
