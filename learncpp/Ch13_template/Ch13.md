## 13.1 Function templates

### What is a function template?

In C++, **function templates** are functions that serve as a pattern for creating other similar functions. The basic idea behind function templates is to create a function without having to specify the exact type(s) of some or all of the variables. Instead, we define the function using placeholder types, called **template type parameters**.  Once we have created a function using these placeholder types, we have effectively created a “function stencil”.

```c++
template <typename T>
T max(T x, T y) {
    return (x > y) ? x : y;
}
```
