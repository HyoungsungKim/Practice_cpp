## 8.2 Classes and class members

### A note about structs in C++

In C, structs can only hold data, and do not have associated member functions. In C++, after designing classes (using the class keyword), Bjarne Stroustrup spent some amount of time considering whether structs (which were inherited from C) should be granted the ability to have member functions. Upon consideration, he determined that they should, in part to have a unified ruleset for both. ***So although we wrote the  above programs using the class keyword, we could have used the struct keyword instead***.

Many developers (including myself) feel this was the incorrect decision to be made, as it can lead to dangerous assumptions. For  example, it’s fair to assume a class will clean up after itself (e.g. a class that allocates memory will deallocate it before being destroyed), but it’s not safe to assume a struct will.

- ***Consequently, we recommend using the struct keyword for data-only structures, and the class keyword for defining objects that require both data and functions to be bundled together***.
- 구조체를 클래스 대신 사용 할 수 있음. 하지만 구조체는 종료되면 메모리 회수를 하지 않기 때문에 구조체를 클래스 대용으로 쓰는건 권장 되지 않음.
- 그리고 구조체는 default member가 public인데 클래스는 private임

## 8.5 Constructors

If all members are public, we can use aggregate initialize

```c++
class Foo {
    public:
    	int m_x;
   		int m_y;
};

int main(){
    Foo foo1 = {4, 5};
    Foo foo2 {6, 7};
    
    return 0;
}
```

However, when there is a private member then it is not possible.

- We have to use constructor

### Default class

```c++

14
15

class Date
{
private:
    // Note: No initializations at member declarations
    int m_year;
    int m_month;
    int m_day;
 
public:
    // Explicitly defaulted constructor
    Date() = default;
};
 
class Date2
{
private:
    // Note: No initializations at member declarations
    int m_year;
    int m_month;
    int m_day;
 
public:
    // Empty user-provided constructor
    Date2() {};
};
 
int main()
{
    Date today{}; // today is 0, 0, 0
    Date2 tomorrow{}; // tomorrows's members are uninitialized
 
    return 0;
}
```

### Classes containing classes

```c++
#include <iostream>
 
class A
{
public:
    A() { std::cout << "A\n"; }
};
 
class B
{
private:
    A m_a; // B contains A as a member variable
 
public:
    B() { std::cout << "B\n"; }
};
 
int main()
{
    B b;
    return 0;
}
// This prints
/*
A
B
*/
```

- When variable `b` is constructed, the `B()` constructor is called.  Before the body of the constructor executes, `m_a` is initialized, calling the `class A` default constructor.  This prints “A”.  Then control returns back to the `B` constructor, and the body of the B constructor executes.
  - The difference to the last example in the previous section is that `m_a` is a `class`-type. ***`class`-type members get initialized even if we don’t explicitly initialize them***.

## 8.5a Member initializer (list)

```c++
class Something {
    private:
    	const int m_value;
    
    public:
    	Something(): m_value{5} {}
}
```

- Member initializer list is possible to initialize const variable

## 8.6 Overlapping and delegating constructors

### Delegating constructors

```c++
class Foo {
    private:
    public:
    	Foo() {
            
        }
    
    	Foo(int value): Foo{} {
            
        }
}
```

## 8.7 Destructors

A **destructor** is another special kind of class member  function that is executed when an object of that class is destroyed.  Whereas constructors are designed to initialize a class, ***destructors are designed to help clean up***.

- For simple classes (those that just initialize the values of normal member variables), a destructor is not needed because C++ will  automatically clean up the memory for you.
- However, if your class object is holding any resources (e.g. dynamic memory, or a file or database handle), or if you need to do any kind of maintenance before the object is destroyed, the destructor is the perfect place to do so, as it is typically the last thing to happen  before the object is destroyed.

### Destructor naming

Like constructors, destructors have specific naming rules:

- The destructor must have the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde (~).
- The destructor can not take arguments.
- The destructor has no return type.

### Constructor and destructor timing

As mentioned previously, the constructor is called when an object is created, and the destructor is called when an object is destroyed.
