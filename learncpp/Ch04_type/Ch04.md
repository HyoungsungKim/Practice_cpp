## Bad: Using object-like macros with a substitution parameter as symbolic constants

So why not use #define to make symbolic constants?  There are (at least) three major problems.

- First, because macros are resolved by the preprocessor, which replaces the symbolic name with the defined value, #defined symbolic constants do not show up in the debugger (which shows you your actual code).
  - 디버거에 숫자가 아니라 이름으로 나옴
  - So although the compiler would compile `int max_students { numClassrooms * 30 };`, in the debugger you’d see `int max_students { numClassrooms * MAX_STUDENTS_PER_CLASS };`,
  - ***MAX_STUDENTS_PER_CLASS would not be watchable***. You’d have to go find the definition of MAX_STUDENTS_PER_CLASS in order to know what the actual value was. This can make your programs harder to debug.
- Second, macros can conflict with normal code.
- Thirdly, macros don’t follow normal scoping rules, which means in rare cases a macro defined in one part of a program can conflict with code written in another part of the program that it wasn’t supposed to  interact with.
